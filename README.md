# MiA-Project
This repository contains the code for my MiA project: <b>"Ranking CMIP6 Models with Statistical Distances"</b>.

The first three folders contain the code for the:
- Importation of each climate model
- Pre-processing of the data
- Probability distributions creation
- Calculation of each statistical distance

as well as the stored variable distribution arrays.

The final folder contains the code that ranks the models based on the results found above, and generates model prediction weights.
